# py-pi-finder
Find numbers (strings) in pi (any file).

You can download a copy of the first billion digits of pi from [here](https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/contrib/pi/pi-billion.txt) and its MD5 checksum from [here](https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/contrib/pi/pi-billion.md5).

pi-billion.txt (or another file you would like) should be in your working directory (i.e. pwd). If you decide to use another file, or rename pi-billion.txt, you should change the respective part in [main.py](main.py).
